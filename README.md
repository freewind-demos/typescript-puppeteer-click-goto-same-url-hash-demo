TypeScript Puppeteer Click To New Url and Wait For Navigation Demo
==================================================================

```
npm install -g puppeteer
npm run demo
```

Note: since puppteteer needs to download a very huge Chrome which makes the installation quite slow,
I prefer install puppteteer globally and link it to this project before running.
